# 🌐 SUBCULTURE COLLECTIVE (SUBCULT)

**Tools, art, and infrastructure for digital subcultures.**  
At the intersections of technology, media, and radical imagination.

---

## 🧠 What we are

**SUBCULT** is an independent collective of developers, artists, and thinkers building projects that live between **culture**, **code**, and **critique**.

We believe technology should **empower communities** instead of extracting from them — and that art + software can be instruments for resistance, education, and transformation.

---

## 🧩 What we build

- **Community tools** — platforms and systems that help people organize and connect  
- **Data transparency** — projects that make public social data visible and understandable  
- **Interactive media** — games, art, and experiments that invite participation  
- **Cultural software** — small, weird, expressive tools that push boundaries
