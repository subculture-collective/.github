Exploring the intersections of technology, media, and radical imagination.

## 🧠 About Us

**Sub-Culture Collective** (stylized as **SUBCULT**) is an independent collective of developers, artists, and thinkers creating projects that live between culture, code, and critique.  
We believe technology should empower communities, not exploit them — and that art and code can be vehicles for resistance, education, and transformation.

We’re building open-source and creative projects around:

- 🧩 **Community tools** — platforms and systems that help people organize and connect.  
- 📊 **Data transparency** — projects that make social data visible and understandable.  
- 🕹️ **Interactive media** — games, art, and experiments that invite participation.  
- 🎛️ **Cultural software** — small, weird, and expressive code that pushes boundaries.
